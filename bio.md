## About Me
I currently work at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) as a Senior Research Scientist focused on [cyber-physical systems](http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/cyber-physical-systems.html) (CPS). Earlier, at MathWorks, I used to be a software engineer working on core semantics of [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html). As an intern at [Bosch Research and Technology Center](http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm) in Pittsburgh, I developed a model-based approach to non-intrusive load monitoring. At [Cummins](http://www.cumminsindia.com/), I worked on the development and application engineering of electronic control systems for diesel-engine applications. 

I have a Ph.D. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Bruce Krogh](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/department/faculty/K/Bruce_Krogh_89.html), and an M.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) advised by [Prof. George Pappas](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pappasg).
