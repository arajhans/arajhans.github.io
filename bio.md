## Biography

Dr. Akshay Rajhans is a Senior Research Scientist in the Advanced Research & Technology Office at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) where his work focuses on Technical Computing for, and Model-Based Design and Analysis of, [cyber-physical systems](http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/cyber-physical-systems.html) (CPS). 

In his current multi-faceted role, Dr. Rajhans works on increasing the impact of technical computing research along various axes. He engages the research community via leadership roles at MathWorks Research Summits and at external research conferences worldwide. He co-manages a collaborative research grant program for facilitating bidirectional technology transfer. Via invited talks, panels, and research publications, he disseminates technical knowledge, often providing an industry perspective to academia, and an academic and research perspective to industry. He serves on Industry Advisory Boards for various universities, conferences, and professional organizations, on Ph.D. Thesis and Technical Committees, and on the Editorial Advisory Board of an upcoming book on Resilience of CPS.

Prior to joining MathWorks, Dr. Rajhans worked on development and application engineering of electronic control systems for diesel-engine applications at [Cummins](http://www.cumminsindia.com/). As an intern at [Bosch Research and Technology Center](http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm) in Pittsburgh, he developed a model-based approach to non-intrusive load monitoring. 

Dr. Rajhans has a Ph.D. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and an M.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/). He is a member of IEEE and ACM.
