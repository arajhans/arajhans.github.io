== Bio and Technical Interests
I currently work at MathWorks as a Senior Research Scientist focused on [http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/cyber-physical-systems.html /cyber-physical systems/] (CPS). Earlier, at MathWorks, I used to be a software engineer working on core semantics of Simulink. I have worked at [http://www.cumminsindia.com/ Cummins India Limited] on the development and application engineering of electronic control systems for diesel-engine applications. As an intern at [http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm Bosch Research and Technology Center] in Pittsburgh, I developed a model-based approach to non-intrusive load monitoring. 

I have a Ph.D. in [https://www.ece.cmu.edu/ Electrical and Computer Engineering] from [http://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University] advised by [https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/department/faculty/K/Bruce_Krogh_89.html Prof. Bruce Krogh], and an M.S. in [www.ese.upenn.edu/ Electrical Engineering] from the [www.ese.upenn.edu/ University of Pennsylvania] advised by [https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pappasg Prof. George Pappas]. My academic research in graduate school was based in CPS domain, particularly their mathematical representations called /hybrid systems/, the use of /software architecture/ principles towards CPS design and disciplined engineering, and the use of /formal methods/ for providing system-level guarantees.
