## Biographical Sketch
I currently work at MathWorks as a Senior Research Scientist focused on cyber-physical systems (CPS). Earlier, at MathWorks, I used to be a software engineer working on core semantics of Simulink. I have worked at Cummins India Limited on the development and application engineering of electronic control systems for diesel-engine applications. As an intern at Bosch Research and Technology Center in Pittsburgh, I developed a model-based approach to non-intrusive load monitoring.

I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Bruce Krogh, and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania advised by Prof. George Pappas. My academic research in graduate school was in the CPS domain, particularly their mathematical representations called hybrid systems, the use of software architecture principles towards CPS design and disciplined engineering, and the use of formal methods for providing system-level guarantees.
